    "prompt": "You're given a math problem and its paraphrased version. Your task is to evaluate whether the paraphrased problem is logically valid and matches the described technique.\n\n--- Original Problem ---\n{original}\n\n--- Paraphrased Technique ---\nTechnique: {technique}\nDescription: {description}\nExample: \nOriginal: {example_original}\nParaphrased: {example}\n\n--- Paraphrased Problem ---\n{paraphrased_problem}\n\nPlease answer:\n1. Is the paraphrased problem logically consistent with the original? (Yes/No)\n2. Does the paraphrased problem match the described technique? (Yes/No)\n3. Brief justification.\nReturn your answer in JSON format like:\n{\n  \"logical_consistency\": \"Yes\",\n  \"technique_match\": \"Yes\",\n  \"justification\": \"...\"\n}\n\nIf the paraphrased technique does not visibly change the original problem, but this is because the original already aligns with the paraphrase technique, answer \"Yes\" for technique_match. If any numerical values are changed in a way that affects the problemâ€™s meaning or answer, answer \"No\" for logical_consistency."
